Department of Science- Core principles
“The solutions to political and ethical dilemmas involving science and technology cannot be the subject of informed debate unless young people possess certain scientific awareness. While this does not mean turning everyone into a scientific expert it does mean providing them with a science education that would enable them to fulfill an enlightened role in making choices which affect their environment and to understand in broad terms the social implications of debates between experts” (European Commission, 1995)
“A science education should be both broad and applied. Thus, the framework refers to a knowledge of science, science-based technology, and scientific and engineering practices. It should be noted, however, that science and technology do differ in their purposes, processes, and products. Technology asks: “What can we do with this knowledge?” seeking the optimal solution to a human problem where there may be more than one optimal solution. In contrast, science seeks to answer three questions about the natural material world: (1) What exists? (2) Why does any given phenomenon happen? and (3) How do we know? “(PISA 2025 Science Framework)
Science fuels our understanding of the world and holds the key to solving tomorrow's challenges. In the Department of Science at The Excelsior School, we are committed to fostering a love of science and nurturing the next generation of scientific thinkers.
