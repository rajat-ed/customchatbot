Dear Science Educators,
Welcome to The Excelsior School Science Department! Whether you are joining us for the first time or have been a part of this journey for years, we are thrilled to have you as a vital member of our team. As educators, we are entrusted with the responsibility of inspiring curiosity, fostering a love for discovery, and guiding our students in their exploration of the world through the lens of science.
Science is not just a subject; it’s a way of thinking—a pursuit of truth, understanding, and innovation. Our role as teachers is to nurture these skills in our students, empowering them to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and solve real-world problems. This handbook is designed to support you in this mission, offering guidance on our shared goals, responsibilities, and the values we hold dear.
At Excelsior, we believe that education is a collaborative effort, and your expertise and passion are at the heart of what we do. By working together—sharing ideas, supporting one another, and staying committed to our vision—we can ensure that every student is not only prepared for academic success but also inspired to be a lifelong learner.
We value the unique strengths each of you brings to our department, and we are here to support you in every way possible. Let’s make this year one of growth, discovery, and meaningful impact, both for ourselves and for our students.
Thank you for your dedication and commitment to making science come alive in our classrooms.

Warm regards,
Department of Science

Department of Science – Core Principles

“The solutions to political and ethical dilemmas involving science and technology cannot be the subject of informed debate unless young people possess certain scientific awareness. While this does not mean turning everyone into a scientific expert, it does mean providing them with a science education that would enable them to fulfill an enlightened role in making choices which affect their environment and to understand in broad terms the social implications of debates between experts.”
    — European Commission, 1995

    “A science education should be both broad and applied. Thus, the framework refers to a knowledge of science, science-based technology, and scientific and engineering practices. It should be noted, however, that science and technology do differ in their purposes, processes, and products. Technology asks: ‘What can we do with this knowledge?’ seeking the optimal solution to a human problem where there may be more than one optimal solution. In contrast, science seeks to answer three questions about the natural material world:
    (1) What exists?
    (2) Why does any given phenomenon happen?
    (3) How do we know?”
    — PISA 2025 Science Framework

Science fuels our understanding of the world and holds the key to solving tomorrow's challenges. In the Department of Science at The Excelsior School, we are committed to fostering a love of science and nurturing the next generation of scientific thinkers.
