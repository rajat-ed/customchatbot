# Custom Chatbot Template

A simple, customizable chatbot template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the Gemini API. This project provides a foundation for creating your own AI-driven chatbot with a modern interface, conversation history, and a typing animation for a polished user experience.

## Features

- **Gemini API Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for smart, context-aware responses.
- **Plain Text Context**: Loads context from a `context.txt` file to customize the chatbot’s knowledge base.
- **Typing Animation**: Responses appear with a smooth, character-by-character typing effect.
- **Modern UI**: Wide, ChatGPT-like design with a sidebar logo and top-centered title.
- **Conversation History**: Tracks chat history for coherent interactions.
- **Easy to Customize**: Adjust context, styling, or API settings with minimal effort.
